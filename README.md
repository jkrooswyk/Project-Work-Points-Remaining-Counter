Project-Work-Points-Remaining-Counter
=====================================

There are actually 2 apps in here: the two together give a snapshot of project status across an entire project (all stories) for users who typically work through entire backlogs on smaller, repetitive projects.
<P>
The first app is a simple counter that looks at how many estimated story points remain until a project is complete.

<P>
The second app shows status of each iteration for this project, its current status, and points planned versus accepted.
